Summary
=======

Ordinarily this is where I'd put any interesting code I figured out about
Twilio's `Super SIM` product, but all I have is a dumb story about how neither
of us wanted to.

Background
==========

Twilio offers an interesting SIM product, called Super SIM. They can tell you
all about the reasons it's cool, I thought it was interesting, and decided I
would like to get one. It costs $3 to order one.

In order to buy a SIM, I had to upgrade my account from free tier and set up
billing. They were strangely insistent on loading at least 20 bucks to get
started, that seemed OK, I'll probably use it up pretty quick if the SIM card
gets useful

So I loaded 20 bucks and used $3 of it to purchase a SIM card to play with.

What happened
=============

Twilio started sending me emails requiring increasingly detailed, invasive,
and time consuming demands about what I was doing with Twilio. These emails
each required a response withing 72 hours, or my account would be suspended.

When i stopped responding after the third email, with no indication they had
read or acknowledged my responses to the first two, they suspended my account,
sent me a 4th email demanding my linkedin or github or whatever i can do to
investigate myself for them, if i want to get unsuspended. My $20 vanished,
and I got an email from billing telling me my account was overdrawn by $3.

At this point I am no longer interested in becoming unsuspended, demand they
not steal $20 dollars from me, and invite them to "go jump in a lake"

They respond with an apology that their onboarding hasn't met expectations,
and a promise to give me my money back. But for some reason they still want
to know if i would "be able to provide your personal LinkedIn profile, GitHub
or any publicly available information that will help us verify your identity?
This may include any social media pages or websites that you are associated with."

So, here it is, my Github, for you.

What they Wanted
================

I gathered all the stuff they were asking. My responses were increasingly
strident variants of the honest truth:

* its for personal use
* there's no app, company, idea, website, or money
* im just a guy that likes to play with computers
* i might use SMS, it would only be to friends and family
